Through its rich and lengthy history, it remains evident that the State Fair serves not only as an annual celebration but as a unique destination that brings people from all walks of life together to create lifelong memories.

*CELEBRATE TRADITION

Texas heritage is strong, and the State Fair embodies all aspects of Lone Star culture. Although much has changed since its humble beginnings, the State Fair of Texas still embraces its roots and preserves the traditions upon which it was built. After serving as the State Fair’s home for a whole century, Fair Park was officially designated a National Historic Landmark in 1986 because of its historical significance. With 132 years of shared history, the State Fair has maintained a deep-rooted connection to Fair Park and continues to call it home. Year after year millions of Fair Park visitors come from far and wide to experience the State Fair of Texas and visit its beloved icon, Big Tex.

*CELEBRATE AGRICULTURE

Agriculture serves not only as a pillar of this organization but as a fundamental feature of the Lone Star State and its history. The State Fair of Texas offers a variety of interactive exhibits focusing on agriculture and livestock – implementing hands-on activities that are both fun and informative. Activities range from feeding furry friends at the petting zoo, to learning about different livestock species during daily guided tours through the livestock barns.

Each year approximately 5,200 students from around the state work diligently in preparation for the competitive livestock events and leadership contests at the State Fair. The largest of these events, the annual Youth Livestock Auction, celebrates the agricultural heritage of our great state while providing scholarships and prizes to students all over Texas.
